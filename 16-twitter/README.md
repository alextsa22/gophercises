2.  Authenticate with the Twitter API
3.  Use the Twitter API to determine which users have retweeted a specific tweet.
4.  Open (or create) a file containing a list of unique usernames who have retweeted the tweet, and update it with new users retrieved from your API call in step (2).
5.  If a flag or some other option is set to pick a winner, read the full list of unique usernames and pick a winner and then print out that winner's username.

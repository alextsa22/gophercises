# Exercise #8: Phone Number Normalizer

Exercise details
----------------

This exercise is fairly straight-forward - we are going to be writing a program that will iterate through a database and
normalize all of the phone numbers in the DB. After normalizing all of the data we might find that there are duplicates,
so we will then remove those duplicates keeping just one entry in our database.

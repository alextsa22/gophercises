# Exercise #4: HTML Link Parser

Exercise details
----------------

In this exercise your goal is create a package that makes it easy to parse an HTML file and extract all of the
links (`<a href="">...</a>` tags). For each extracted link you should return a data structure that includes both
the `href`, as well as the text inside the link. Any HTML inside of the link can be stripped out, along with any extra
whitespace including newlines, back-to-back spaces, etc.

# Exercise #13: Quiet HN

Exercise details
----------------

One of the most common approaches to learning a new language is to rebuild things you know. As a result, you will often
find tons of clones for websites like Twitter, Hacker News (HN), Pinterest, and countless others. The clones are rarely
better than the original, but that isn't the point. The point is to build something you know so that you can eliminate a
lot of the guesswork and uncertainty that comes with building something new.

In this exercise we aren't going to be building a clone from scratch, but we are going to take a relatively simple
Hacker News clone (called Quiet Hacker News) and use it to explore concurrency and caching in Go.

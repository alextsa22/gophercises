# Exercise #15: Development Panic/Recover Middleware with Chroma

Exercise details
----------------

In the recover exercise we learned how to create some HTTP middleware that recovers from any panics in our application
and renders a stack trace if we are in a local development environment. In this exercise we will be taking that code a
step further; we will be adding in the ability to navigate to any source file in the panic stack trace in order to make
it easier to debug issues when they arise in a development environment.

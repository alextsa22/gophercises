# Exercise #10: Blackjack Game

Exercise details
----------------

Now that we have a deck of cards to work with, we want to build something using the cards. Blackjack is a relatively
simple card game with a simple AI, so that will be the focus of this exercise. We won't be building out all of the
rules, but we will implement the major ones and you are welcome to expand upon the game once you have it working.

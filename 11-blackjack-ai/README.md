# Exercise #11: Blackjack AI

Exercise details
----------------

In this exercise we are going to explore how we might refactor some code - like the code used to create our blackjack
game - into a package that might be used by other developers. In doing this, we will need to ask ourselves which
functions, types, and other data types should be exported and documented vs which should be unexported and kept as
simply implementation details.
